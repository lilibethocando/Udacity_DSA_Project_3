# Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries

For solving this problem, I implemented a TrieNode and Trie class as requested and then created a 
"suffixes" function that returns a list with all suffixes for a given letter (prefix) if it exists.

Time complexity of this problem is **O(n)** and space complexity is **O(n)**.
