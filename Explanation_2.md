# Problem 2: Search in a Rotated Sorted Array

For solving this issue I used binary search algorithm.
A sorted array is provided but then is rotated, so for solving it, 
I calculated the mid and then used multiple conditionals for calculating the left and right indexes again
when the array is rotated.

Time Complexity is **O(log(n))** and Space Complexity is **O(1)**.
