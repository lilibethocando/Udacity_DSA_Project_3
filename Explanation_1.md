# Problem 1, Finding the Square Root of an Integer

I used the binary search algorithm for finding the Square Root of a number
if the square was between the middle element and a number above, 
the middle element is returned as the floored square root. 

Time Complexity is **O(log(n))** and Space Complexity is **O(1)**.
