# Problem 3 : Rearrange Array Elements

For solving this issue, I used the Merge Sort Algorithm
from which I got to order the array and rearranged the numbers from bigger to smaller 
returning the max combination.

Time complexity of this problem is **O(log n)** and space complexity of this problem is **O(1)**.
