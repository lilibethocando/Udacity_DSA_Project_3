# Problem 6: Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

for solving this issue, I created 2 variables min_ and max_ both of them starting 
at the same point on the list of integers. Then, proceeded to compare each of them
and returned a tuple with the min and max integers. 

Time Complexity of this problem is **O(n)** and Space Complexity is **O(n)**.
