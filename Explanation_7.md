# Problem 7: HTTPRouter using a Trie

For solving this issue, I completed the requested classes RouteTrie, RouteTrieNode, and Router
Using the Trie DS. 

For the **RouteTrie** (lookup and handler), the time complexity and space complexity are both **O(n)**.

For the **RouteTrieNode**, the time complexity and space complexity are both **O(m*n)**.
